# BridgeStream 


BridgeStream is an order oriented binary serialization library developed for performance and efficiency.

BridgeStream is used as a part of an real-time online game to
transmit data between the client and servers.

You can encode/decode primitive types, collection of primitives, custom serializers and other BridgeStream's easily
and efficiently.

Check out the [python implementation](https://github.com/Gnarly-Games/python-bridgestream) if you need a slower language.

Check out the [C# implementation](https://github.com/Gnarly-Games/csharp-bridgestream) if you love typing.
